# TheHigherProgramming

This is a repository of my implementations of different mathematical algorithms in python & its superset, sage. It will mostly have number theory and cryptography algorithms, mostly because they are my favorite areas of math. Though anything can be added in the future

The name is a spoof on The Higher Arithmetic by H. Davenport, a Number Theory book which I'm studying
