I experimented a lot with this Class, going back and forth on whether I
should add it or nor. First problem was that __init__ messed up the
two numbers, and so I got rid of it opting for passing arguments. I tried
using @staticmethod for the methods, but the last recursive one had some
troubles and needed self, so I kept it for uniformity. I went with it
mainly because of the contained scope. Ok after I understood that this doesn't
need to be .sage and converted it to python the class becomes kinda obsolete,
but i'll keep it cause I'm bored to change it
